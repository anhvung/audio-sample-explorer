**You don't need to run any python code if you download the data. Running the D3.html from a local webserver is enough.**

- **training.ipynb**: model training code
- **data.ipynb**: data preperation and exporting for D3
- **D3.html**: make sure to run the file from a local webserver like **MAMP** or **XAMPP** (otherwise the files won't load)
